I learned alot in python last year. I learned how to code with variables, i learned how to code function, and i learned abt how to code math.
Last year I coded a menu for a  restaurant it was stressing but fun.

When learning to code, meticulously following instructions exactly as given is crucial because coding operates on strict logic, where even minor deviations from the intended syntax or structure can lead to errors and prevent the program from functioning correctly; this disciplined approach helps build a solid foundation in coding principles and reinforces the importance of precise language, allowing you to understand how each element contributes to the overall code functionality and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

Software Engineer.
A software engineer designs, develops, and maintains software and computer applications. They use engineering principles and programming languages to create solutions that meet the needs of users and the company. 
Software engineers need a variety of skills, including technical skills, problem-solving skills, and communication skills: 
Technical skills: Knowledge of programming languages, such as Python and JavaScript, as well as computer science, design, and software development. 
Problem-solving skills: The ability to find problems, come up with solutions, and test and debug code. 
Communication skills: The ability to work with other engineers, designers, and project managers to ensure everyone is on the same page. 
Attention to detail: The ability to spot small errors and optimize software for users. 
Teamwork: The ability to collaborate with others to achieve the best results. 
Testing and debugging: The ability to ensure software works as intended and to identify and fix any issues. 
Object-oriented programming: The ability to understand how objects in object-oriented programming relate to real-world entities. 
Software engineers often use a variety of tools, and interviews for software engineer positions typically include technical questions, exercises, and projects. 
To become a software engineer, you typically need at least a bachelor's degree in computer science or software engineering. However, some companies may require a master's degree, and a doctorate may be necessary for research positions. 
In addition to formal education, you should also have strong programming skills and knowledge of various programming languages. Practical experience through internships or projects can also be beneficial. 
If you don't have the time or resources to attend a four-year degree program, you could consider an online bootcamp or course. Bootcamps are often cheaper and faster than a degree program, and many offer career support or guaranteed job placement. However, bootcamps tend to focus on web-based coding rather than software engineering. A typical career growth path for a software engineer involves starting as a junior developer, gaining experience to become a mid-level engineer, then progressing to a senior level with more complex projects and leadership responsibilities, potentially leading to technical leadership roles like a tech lead or architect, often requiring continued learning and specialization in specific technologies or areas like cloud computing, data science, or mobile development. This career alighns with my goals because i want to be successful.
